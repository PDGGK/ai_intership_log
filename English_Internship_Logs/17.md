## Core Issues Analysis 🎯

### 1. Major Technical Challenges ⚠️
- **GPU Memory Overflow Issue** 💾: Excessive GPU memory usage caused by concurrent requests due to asynchronous characteristics in PDF processing
- **Request Accumulation Phenomenon** 📊: Logs showing multiple model invocation requests triggered in a short period
- **Resource Management Challenges** ⚖️: Need to find a balance between efficiency and resource utilization

### 2. Problem Discovery Process 🔍
1. Identified request concentration issues through log timeline analysis
2. In-depth study of the `async/await` mechanism revealed the root cause
3. Confirmed the negative impact of asynchronous features in this scenario

> Key Finding: The advantages of asynchronous programming can sometimes become disadvantages, especially in resource-intensive tasks.

## Technical Deep Dive 🔬

### 1. Asynchronous Programming Pitfalls 🕳️
```python
async def process_pdf_document(content: bytes, prompt: str):
    for page in pages:
        # The await here doesn't prevent the next iteration from starting immediately
        response = await process_page(page)
        # Leading to multiple page requests being sent to the model simultaneously
```

### 2. Solution Comparison ⚖️

#### Solution 1: Synchronous Processing 🔒
```python
def process_pdf_document(content: bytes, prompt: str):
    for page in pages:
        # Process strictly in sequence
        response = synchronous_process_page(page)
        # Ensure one page is completely processed before continuing to the next
```

#### Solution 2: Asynchronous Control 🔄
```python
async def process_pdf_document(content: bytes, prompt: str):
    async with Semaphore(1):
        for page in pages:
            response = await process_page(page)
            await asyncio.sleep(3)  # Force waiting interval
```
