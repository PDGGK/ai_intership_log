## Knowledge Expansion 📚

### Virtualization Technology Fundamentals 🏗️
Virtualization technology plays a key role in modern development, primarily in the following aspects:

1. **Environment Isolation** 🔒
   - Physical resource virtualization
   - Operating system-level isolation
   - Application environment independence

2. **Network Virtualization** 🌐
   - Virtual network adapter types:
     ```plaintext
     - vmnet0: Bridged mode
     - vmnet1: Host-only mode
     - vmnet8: NAT mode
     ```
   - Network configuration parameters:
     ```bash
     bridge100: 192.168.239.1/24
     bridge101: 192.168.110.1/24
     ```

### Development Environment Configuration ⚙️
Detailed environment configuration steps and key concepts:

1. **SSH Remote Connection** 🔑
   ```bash
   # Basic connection command
   ssh mu@192.168.110.130
   
   # Network configuration check
   ifconfig
   ```

2. **VSCode Remote Development** 💻
   > The VSCode Remote-SSH extension provides powerful remote development capabilities, supporting direct editing of remote files from the local machine.

3. **Python Environment Management** 🐍
   ```bash
   # Install package management tool
   sudo apt install python3-pip
   
   # Install development dependencies
   sudo apt install python3-dev build-essential
   
   # Install project dependencies
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Technical Deep Dive 🔬

### Virtual Network Architecture 🌐
Virtual network configuration involves technical integration at multiple levels:

1. **Network Mode Selection** 🔄
   - `Bridged Mode`: Direct communication with the physical network
   - `NAT Mode`: Access to external networks through Network Address Translation
   - `Host-only Mode`: Independent virtual network environment

2. **Network Interface Configuration** ⚙️
   ```plaintext
   Physical Host (Mac)
   ├── VMware
   │   ├── bridge100 (192.168.239.1)
   │   │   └── vmenet0
   │   └── bridge101 (192.168.110.1)
   │       ├── vmenet1
   │       ├── vmenet2
   │       └── vmenet3
   ```

### Development Toolchain Integration 🛠️
Modern development environment toolchain integration:

1. **Version Control Integration** 🔄
   - Git repository cloning and management
   - Branch management and collaboration
   - Code version tracking

2. **IDE Remote Development Features** 💻
   - File synchronization mechanism
   - Remote debugging capabilities
   - Terminal integration
