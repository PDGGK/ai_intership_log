## Implementation Steps <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Implementation-4CAF50?style=flat-square&logo=code&logoColor=white"/>

### 1. Environment Preparation 🛠️

First, establish an independent development environment using a virtual environment for isolation:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv community_env

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows
community_env\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac
source community_env/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install requests pandas openpyxl
```

### 2. Obtain Baidu Map API Key 🔑

Before using the Baidu Map API, complete the following steps:

1. Register for a Baidu Map developer account
2. Create an application to obtain an AK (Access Key)
3. Configure IP whitelist
   - For development and testing: 0.0.0.0/0
   - For production: Specific IP addresses recommended

### 3. Core Code Implementation 💻

#### 3.1 API Call Encapsulation

```python
class BaiduMapAPI:
    def __init__(self, ak):
        self.ak = ak
        self.base_url = "https://api.map.baidu.com"
        
    def search_place(self, query, region="Beijing"):
        """Search for community information"""
        url = f"{self.base_url}/place/v2/search"
        params = {
            "query": query,
            "region": region,
            "output": "json",
            "ak": self.ak,
            "tag": "residential",
            "scope": 2  # Return detailed information
        }
        
        try:
            response = requests.get(url, params=params)
            data = response.json()
            if data.get("status") == 0:
                return data.get("results", [])
            return []
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error searching for {query}: {str(e)}")
            return []
```

#### 3.2 Year Extraction Functionality

```python
def extract_year(detail_info):
    """Extract construction year from detailed information"""
    keywords = ["construction year", "completion time", "built time", "building era"]
    info = str(detail_info).lower()
    
    for keyword in keywords:
        if keyword in info:
            try:
                import re
                years = re.findall(r'19\d{2}|20\d{2}', info)
                if years:
                    return int(years[0])
            except:
                pass
    return None
```

#### 3.3 Data Analysis and Statistics

```python
def analyze_communities(filename, ak):
    """Analyze community list"""
    api = BaiduMapAPI(ak)
    results = []
    
    with open(filename, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        communities = [line.strip() for line in f if line.strip()]
    
    for community in communities:
        places = api.search_place(community)
        
        if places:
            place = places[0]
            year = extract_year(place.get("detail_info", {}))
            
            result = {
                "Community Name": community,
                "Construction Year": year,
                "Is Old Community": "Yes" if year and year < 2010 else "Unknown" if year is None else "No",
                "Address": place.get("address", ""),
                "Longitude": place.get("location", {}).get("lng", ""),
                "Latitude": place.get("location", {}).get("lat", "")
            }
        else:
            result = {
                "Community Name": community,
                "Construction Year": None,
                "Is Old Community": "Unknown",
                "Address": "",
                "Longitude": "",
                "Latitude": ""
            }
            
        results.append(result)
        time.sleep(0.5)  # Avoid too frequent requests
```

### 4. Data Visualization and Statistics 📊

```python
def print_statistics(results):
    """Output statistical information"""
    total = len(results)
    old = sum(1 for r in results if r["Is Old Community"] == "Yes")
    new = sum(1 for r in results if r["Is Old Community"] == "No")
    unknown = sum(1 for r in results if r["Is Old Community"] == "Unknown")
    
    print(f"\nStatistics:")
    print(f"Total communities: {total}")
    print(f"Old communities: {old}")
    print(f"New communities: {new}")
    print(f"Unknown: {unknown}")
    
    # Calculate proportions
    valid_total = total - unknown
    if valid_total > 0:
        old_ratio = (old / valid_total) * 100
        print(f"Old community ratio: {old_ratio:.1f}% (excluding unknown)")
        print(f"Old community ratio: {(old / total * 100):.1f}% (including unknown)")
```
