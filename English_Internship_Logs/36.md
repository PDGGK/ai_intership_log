## 2. Core Technology Implementation

### 2.1 ReAct Architecture Design

> **ReAct** is an AI architecture that combines reasoning and acting, enabling AI to:
> 1. Think about the current state and requirements
> 2. Decide on the next action
> 3. Execute actions and observe results
> 4. Continue reasoning based on results

Below is an example of ReAct implementation in the system:

```python
async def _execute_react_loop(self, 
                           prompt: str, 
                           max_steps: int = 5,
                           temperature: float = 0.7) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Execute ReAct loop"""
    try:
        current_prompt = prompt
        history = []
        
        for step in range(max_steps):
            # Get LLM response
            response = await llm_chat(current_prompt, temperature=temperature)
            
            # Parse the latest tool call
            tool_name, tool_args = await self._parse_latest_plugin_call(response)
            if not tool_name:
                continue
                
            # Execute tool call
            result = await self._execute_tool(tool_name, tool_args)
            
            # Record history
            history.append({
                "step": step + 1,
                "thought": self._extract_thought(response),
                "action": f"{tool_name}: {json.dumps(tool_args)}",
                "result": result
            })
            
            # Update prompt
            current_prompt = f"{current_prompt}\nObservation: {json.dumps(result)}"
            
        return self._generate_final_result(history)
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"ReAct execution failed: {str(e)}")
        return {
            "error": f"Execution failed: {str(e)}",
            "is_valid": False,
            "risk_points": [f"Execution failed: {str(e)}"]
        }
```

### 2.2 Rule Parser

The rule parser is one of the core components of the system, responsible for converting legal provisions in natural language form into machine-understandable structured rules. The main technical points include:

1. ‚úèÔ∏è **Prompt Engineering**: Design specialized prompt templates to guide LLM parsing
2. ‚úÖ **Rule Validation**: Ensure the completeness and correctness of parsing results
3. üîó **Tool Mapping**: Associate rules with specific validation tools

<summary><b>Example Rule Structure</b> (click to expand)</summary>

```json
{
    "rules": [
        {
            "rule_id": "RULE_001",
            "rule_type": "content_requirement",
            "source": "Article 7",
            "description": "Health food advertisement content management regulations",
            "requirements": [
                {
                    "type": "content_check",
                    "content": "Advertisement content must be based on the registration certificate",
                    "mandatory": true
                }
            ],
            "tools_required": [
                {
                    "tool": "text_recognition", 
                    "purpose": "Check text content",
                    "expected_result": "Text content matches registration certificate"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
``` 
</details>

### 2.3 Intelligent Prompt Design

Prompt design is key to ensuring system stability. We adopted a templated prompt management approach:

```python
def get_audit_prompt(self, 
                    text_data: str,
                    tools: Dict[str, Any],
                    rules: List[Dict[str, Any]],
                    context: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> str:
    """Build audit prompt"""
    # Build tool descriptions
    tool_descriptions = []
    for name, info in tools.items():
        desc = f"{name}: {info['description']}\n" \
               f"Parameters: {', '.join(info['required_params'])}"
        tool_descriptions.append(desc)
    
    # Build complete prompt
    prompt = self.react_template.format(
        tools='\n\n'.join(tool_descriptions),
        tool_names=','.join(tools.keys()),
        text_content=text_data,
        image_info=json.dumps(context.get('image_info', {})),
        rules=json.dumps(rules, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)
    )
    
    return prompt
```

## 3. Case Study Analysis

> Let's use a real case of health food advertisement review to illustrate the system's workflow

### Case Process

1. **Scenario Recognition**:
   - ‚ú® The system first identifies that this is a health food advertisement
   - ‚ú® Automatically loads relevant regulatory rules
   
2. **Content Review**:
   - ‚ú® Uses OCR tools to extract advertisement text
   - ‚ú® Checks the prominence of required declarations
   - ‚ú® Verifies the presence of health food logos
   
3. **Risk Assessment**:
   - ‚ú® Checks for efficacy claims beyond approved scope
   - ‚ú® Verifies the standardization of warning language
   - ‚ú® Generates a risk assessment report

## 4. Best Practice Recommendations

In practical applications, we have summarized the following best practices:

### 4.1 Rule Parsing Optimization

1. **Use Progressive Temperature Adjustment**:
```python
# Lower temperature with retry attempts to increase certainty
temperature = max(0.1, 0.7 - attempt * 0.2)
```

2. **Implement Multi-level Error Handling**:
```python
try:
    # Clean response text
    json_text = self._clean_json(response)
    parsed_rules = json.loads(json_text)
    
    # Validate rule format
    if not self._validate_rules(parsed_rules):
        logger.warning("Rule format validation failed")
        continue
except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
    logger.error(f"JSON parsing failed: {str(e)}")
    return {"error": f"Rule parsing failed: {str(e)}"}
```

### 4.2 ReAct Execution Optimization

| Optimization Direction | Implementation Method |
|---------|------------|
| Step Limitation | Set reasonable maximum step limits |
| History Tracking | Implement history record tracking |
| Fault Tolerance | Add timeout protection mechanisms |

### 4.3 Prompt Management

- üìù **Use Templated Management**
- üìù **Add Example Guidance**
- üìù **Implement Dynamic Parameter Replacement**
