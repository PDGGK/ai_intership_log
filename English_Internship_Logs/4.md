## 2024-11-18 Technical Learning Log

### Core Issues Analysis 🎯

### Environment Configuration and Dependency Management ⚙️
#### Problem Background 📋
During the development environment setup process, we encountered a key decision point regarding the choice of dependency management tools. This primarily involved weighing the options between two mainstream tools: `Conda` and `Pip`.

#### Core Decision 🔍
> "Essentially, conda is an environment management tool that also functions as a package manager; while pip is purely a package management tool. This fundamental difference determines many of their characteristics."

**Key Considerations:** 💡
1. Complexity of environment management 🔄
2. Efficiency of the build process ⚡
3. Consistency of deployment environments 🔒
4. Control of maintenance costs 💰

### Docker Environment Configuration Optimization 🐳
#### Infrastructure Setup
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Configure apt sources
RUN echo \
    deb https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/debian/ bullseye main contrib non-free \
    > /etc/apt/sources.list

# System dependency installation
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    git \
    poppler-utils \
    libgl1-mesa-glx \
    libglib2.0-0 \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```

#### Network Configuration Optimization
```json
{
  "registry-mirrors": [
    "https://hub-mirror.c.163.com",
    "https://mirror.baidubce.com",
    "https://registry.docker-cn.com"
  ],
  "dns": [
    "8.8.8.8",
    "8.8.4.4"
  ],
  "max-concurrent-downloads": 3,
  "max-concurrent-uploads": 3,
  "mtu": 1400
}
```

### Knowledge Expansion 📚
