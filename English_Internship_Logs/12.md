## 1. Introduction 📝

When handling large-scale image comparison tasks, systems often face the challenge of insufficient GPU memory. Our system successfully addresses this issue by implementing intelligent adaptive memory management and image quality control mechanisms. This article will analyze in depth the working principles and key implementation details of the system.

## 2. Core Problem Analysis 🎯

### 2.1 GPU Memory Overflow Issue ⚠️
The root causes of the system's failure in the original version, which attempted to allocate 254GB of GPU memory, were:
- No limitations on image dimensions 📏
- Loading multiple images simultaneously during batch processing 🔄
- Lack of memory-adaptive mechanisms 💾

### 2.2 Solution Approach 💡
The system resolves GPU memory issues through the following strategies:
1. Dynamic monitoring of GPU memory usage 📊
2. Adaptive adjustment of image quality based on memory status 🔄
3. Implementation of progressive loading and processing mechanisms ⚡
